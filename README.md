# Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts car selling prices using machine learning. It uses features such as year, mileage, engine power, fuel type, transmission, ownership, and present price. The dataset is cleaned, preprocessed, and encoded for regression modeling.

## Dataset
- Columns: Car_Name, Year, Selling_Price, Present_Price, Driven_kms, Fuel_Type, Selling_type, Transmission, Owner
- Source: Public car price dataset (CSV)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Steps
1. Data loading and cleaning
2. Feature selection and encoding
3. Train-test split
4. Linear Regression model training
5. Model evaluation using MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²
6. Visualization of predicted vs actual prices
